Ok, so I'm trying to teach myself stuff about machine learning, and I've been reading the Stanford notes on CS229.
These mention the *naive Bayes* classification method, and I thought it would be cool to experiment with this.
The classic example seems to be a spam filter, but spam e-mail sent to me seems to consist mainly of images these days, so I thought I'd do something a bit different.
My prediction goal is going to be whether or not a Bloomberg article is about 'tech'.
I don't really need to worry about having an objective measure of what 'tech' is here, I just want a predictor that will accord with my own views.
