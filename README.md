techNotTech
===========

## Goal

Create a perdiction for whether a given Bloomberg article is about tech or not using Naive Bayes.

## BloombergScraper.py

This script takes a URL, and saves the Bloomberg article into a file in a more machine-readable format (also converts all the unicode to ascii).
I then add the line 'Tech' or 'NotTech' to the top of each by hand.
